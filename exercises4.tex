\begin{exercise}[\textbf{Gittins index - bandit reduction}]
Recall that a fundamental ingredient in the index algorithm is the bandit reduction procedure. In this question you will explicitly perform this procedure in a simple case.

We assume that at some point of running the algorithm, the bandit ${i^*}$ corresponds to a 3-state MDP with the following reward rates and transition probabilities:
\[r = \left( {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
1\\
2\\
3
\end{array}} \right),\quad P = \left( {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
{1/4}&{1/2}&{1/4}\\
{1/3}&{1/3}&{1/3}\\
{1/6}&{1/3}&{1/2}
\end{array}} \right),\]
and the durations of all states in ${i^*}$ are deterministic and equal to 1, i.e., $T(s) = 1.$

Assume that ${s^*} = 3,$ and reduce bandit  ${i^*}$ by removing ${s^*}$.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item What are the resulting transitions in the reduced bandit?
  \item What are the distributions of the durations $\hat T(s)$ in the reduced bandit?
  \item What are the reward rates $\hat r(s)$ in the reduced bandit?
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}
